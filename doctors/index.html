She graduated from the University of Auckland and moved to Australia a few years later in 1989. Her 2 daughters grew up in Canberra and she is now a grandma to two in Melbourne and two in the UK.</p>
<p>Julie and her husband, Wayne, live on a 2-acre property and in 2021 began producing their own olive oil. Wayne makes their own wine, beer and cider with produce from the property. She is a passionate skier and also runs and cycles to keep fit, so don’t be surprised if she routinely questions you about exercise! </p>
<p>Julie’s special clinical interests include skin cancer medicine and surgery, which is now a large part of her practice, and women’s health, but she is happy dealing with all areas of medicine. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, because she still has a large following from her Macquarie practice days, she is not currently able to take on new patients.</p>
